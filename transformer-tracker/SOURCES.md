## Methodology

### Lead Time Estimates
Lead times are compiled from multiple sources and represent estimated ranges:

1. **Utility IRP filings** - Often cite specific lead times in resource planning
2. **Industry surveys** - Periodic surveys by trade publications
3. **Manufacturer communications** - Direct quotes from sales/engineering
4. **Conference presentations** - Industry events (IEEE PES, DistribuTECH)
5. **Analyst reports** - Investment bank coverage

**Important caveats:**
- Lead times vary significantly by specification, complexity, and relationship
- Manufacturer backlogs change frequently
- Quoted lead times may exclude engineering/approval phases
- Emergency/expedite orders may differ from standard lead times

### Market Share Estimates
Market share figures are approximate, derived from:
- Manufacturer annual reports (where disclosed)
- Industry analyst estimates
- Trade publication surveys
- Installed base analysis

Market shares vary by:
- Geographic region
- Product segment (LPT vs distribution)
- Voltage class
- Application (utility vs industrial)

### Manufacturer Facility Information
Facility data gathered from:
- Company websites and press releases
- Industry directories
- News articles on expansions/investments
